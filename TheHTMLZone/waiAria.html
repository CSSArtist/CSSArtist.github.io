            ARIA (tabindex) http://www.section508.va.gov/support/webdev/3_2.asp

The Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) specification also provides a mechanism to indicate focus on the parts of a compound control, such as a tree control. This property is the aria-activedescendantproperty. Browsers will use this property when combined with other proper ARIA elements and an ARIA-supported browser to indicate programmatic focus on the correct child node of the tree. For an example of aria-activedescendant, refer to Module 4, User Interface Controls.

In the example below, the aria-activedescendant attribute is set on the parent tree item and contains the ID of the active (focused) tree node. This property must be dynamically updated when the tree node changes either by the user pressing arrow keys to change nodes or when the user selects a tree node with the mouse pointer. Tabindex="0" is set on the container with the role of tree to allow the user to tab to the tree structure. The checkKeyUp function is called when keystrokes are pressed to focus the correct node and performAction function is called when a click is detected within the tree container.

<ul tabindex="0" role="tree " onkeyup="checkKeyUp();" onclick="performAction();">

            	<h3 class="myH3">Classification of of WAI-ARIA States and Properties</h3>

States and properties are categorized as follows:

Widget Attributes
Live Region Attributes
Drag-and-Drop Attributes
Relationship Attributes

6.5.1. Widget Attributes

This section contains attributes specific to common user interface elements found on GUI systems or in rich internet applications which receive user input and process user actions. These attributes are used to support the widget roles.

aria-autocomplete
aria-checked (state)
aria-disabled (state)
aria-expanded (state)
aria-haspopup
aria-hidden (state)
aria-invalid (state)
aria-label
aria-level
aria-multiline
aria-multiselectable
aria-orientation
aria-pressed (state)
aria-readonly
aria-required
aria-selected (state)
aria-sort
aria-valuemax
aria-valuemin
aria-valuenow
aria-valuetext
Widget attributes might be mapped by a user agent to platform accessibility API states, for access by assistive technologies, or they might be accessed directly from the DOM. User agents MUST provide a way for assistive technologies to be notified when states change, either through DOM attribute change events or platform accessibility API events.

6.5.2. Live Region Attributes

#
This section contains attributes specific to live regions in rich internet applications. These attributes may be applied to any element. The purpose of these attributes is to indicate that content changes may occur without the element having focus, and to provide assistive technologies with information on how to process those content updates. Some roles specify a default value for the aria-live attribute specific to that role. An example of a live region is a ticker section that lists updating stock quotes.

aria-atomic
aria-busy (state)
aria-live
aria-relevant
6.5.3. Drag-and-Drop Attributes

#
This section lists attributes which indicate information about drag-and-drop interface elements, such as draggable elements and their drop targets. Drop target information will be rendered visually by the author and provided to assistive technologies through an alternate modality.

aria-dropeffect
aria-grabbed (state)
For more information about using drag-and-drop, see Drag-and-Drop Support in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices ([ARIA-PRACTICES]).

6.5.4. Relationship Attributes

#
This section lists attributes that indicate relationships or associations between elements which cannot be readily determined from the document structure.

aria-activedescendant
aria-controls
aria-describedby
aria-flowto
aria-labelledby
aria-owns
aria-posinset
aria-setsize

            	<h2 class="myH2">Definitions of States and Properties (all aria-* attributes)</h2>
                
Below is an alphabetical list of WAI-ARIA states and properties to be used by rich internet application authors. A detailed definition of each WAI-ARIA state and property follows this compact list.

aria-activedescendant
    Identifies the currently active descendant of a composite widget.
aria-atomic
    Indicates whether assistive technologies will present all, or only parts of, the changed region based on the change notifications defined by the aria-relevant attribute. See related aria-relevant.
aria-autocomplete
    Indicates whether user input completion suggestions are provided.
aria-busy (state)
    Indicates whether an element, and its subtree, are currently being updated.
aria-checked (state)
    Indicates the current "checked" state of checkboxes, radio buttons, and other widgets. See related aria-pressed and aria-selected.
aria-controls
    Identifies the element (or elements) whose contents or presence are controlled by the current element. See related aria-owns.
aria-describedby
    Identifies the element (or elements) that describes the object. See related aria-labelledby.
aria-disabled (state)
    Indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, so it is not editable or otherwise operable. See related aria-hidden and aria-readonly.
aria-dropeffect
    Indicates what functions can be performed when the dragged object is released on the drop target. This allows assistive technologies to convey the possible drag options available to users, including whether a pop-up menu of choices is provided by the application. Typically, drop effect functions can only be provided once an object has been grabbed for a drag operation as the drop effect functions available are dependent on the object being dragged.
aria-expanded (state)
    Indicates whether the element, or another grouping element it controls, is currently expanded or collapsed.
aria-flowto
    Identifies the next element (or elements) in an alternate reading order of content which, at the user's discretion, allows assistive technology to override the general default of reading in document source order.
aria-grabbed (state)
    Indicates an element's "grabbed" state in a drag-and-drop operation.
aria-haspopup
    Indicates that the element has a popup context menu or sub-level menu.
aria-hidden (state)
    Indicates that the element and all of its descendants are not visible or perceivable to any user as implemented by the author. See related aria-disabled.
aria-invalid (state)
    Indicates the entered value does not conform to the format expected by the application.
aria-label
    Defines a string value that labels the current element. See related aria-labelledby.
aria-labelledby
    Identifies the element (or elements) that labels the current element. See related aria-label and aria-describedby.
aria-level
    Defines the hierarchical level of an element within a structure.
aria-live
    Indicates that an element will be updated, and describes the types of updates the user agents, assistive technologies, and user can expect from the live region.
aria-multiline
    Indicates whether a text box accepts multiple lines of input or only a single line.
aria-multiselectable
    Indicates that the user may select more than one item from the current selectable descendants.
aria-orientation
    Indicates whether the element and orientation is horizontal or vertical.
aria-owns
    Identifies an element (or elements) in order to define a visual, functional, or contextual parent/child relationship between DOM elements where the DOM hierarchy cannot be used to represent the relationship. See related aria-controls.
aria-posinset
    Defines an element's number or position in the current set of listitems or treeitems. Not required if all elements in the set are present in the DOM. See related aria-setsize.
aria-pressed (state)
    Indicates the current "pressed" state of toggle buttons. See related aria-checked and aria-selected.
aria-readonly
    Indicates that the element is not editable, but is otherwise operable. See related aria-disabled.
aria-relevant
    Indicates what user agent change notifications (additions, removals, etc.) assistive technologies will receive within a live region. See related aria-atomic.
aria-required
    Indicates that user input is required on the element before a form may be submitted.
aria-selected (state)
    Indicates the current "selected" state of various widgets. See related aria-checked and aria-pressed.
aria-setsize
    Defines the number of items in the current set of listitems or treeitems. Not required if all elements in the set are present in the DOM. See related aria-posinset.
aria-sort
    Indicates if items in a table or grid are sorted in ascending or descending order.
aria-valuemax
    Defines the maximum allowed value for a range widget.
aria-valuemin
    Defines the minimum allowed value for a range widget.
aria-valuenow
    Defines the current value for a range widget. See related aria-valuetext.
aria-valuetext
    Defines the human readable text alternative of aria-valuenow for a range widget.
